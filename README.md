Simple-PRD-Generator
Here's a simple Product Requirements Document (PRD) generator that can enable Product teams to quickly generate Product Requirements to share with stakeholders. This is a simple web app that takes input from a user about the product concept and idea and then creates a comprehensive PRD explaining the problem, solution, product features, success metrics, MVP and key deliveables. It is a 'simple" design because there is no backend or database integrations. It is integrated with Make.com webhook which handles the data request/response from the PRD generator and Open AI for data enrichment of the PRD document.
